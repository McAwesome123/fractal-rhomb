## Introduction

During the normal usage of this bot, it may collect certain types of information regarding you in order to perform certain operations.\
The information collected and how its used is described below in this document.\
**By interacting with this bot (including using its slash commands and directly messaging it), you agree to it collecting, processing, and storing such data as described.**

## What data is collected and why

*In general, any information given to the bot through the use of slash commands may be read and processed. Unless stated otherwise, this information is not stored.*

When using any of the bot's slash commands, it may collect your Discord User ID (hereafter referred to as "User ID") in order to address you in its reply under certain circumstances. In these situations, your User ID is not stored.

For commands starting with `/cache`, the bot may collect your User ID for authorization, as well as store it for the purposes of logging the commands' usage and rate limiting.

For the `/botchannel add` command, the bot will store the ID of the channel given, as well as the ID of the server it is in, so long as a valid channel was given. This is required for the bot to remember what channels have been marked as bot channels.

When sending a Direct Message to the bot, if attempting to use a hidden command (i.e. `-command`), the bot may collect and log your User ID for authorization purposes. If the authorization passes, the bot may log *the entire contents of the message*.

## What data is shared

When addressing you in its replies, the bot will send your User ID to Discord as part of the message's content.

When using commands relating to [fractalthorns](https://fractalthorns.com/) (such as: `/image`, `/description`, `/record`), any parameters not related to formatting (including, but not limited to: image names, record names) may be passed to the website's API in order for the bot to show the requested content.\
If the request is successful, the bot will temporarily store the parameters and results in order to make quicker responses for repeat requests and may log information about the requests. No user data is stored as part of this.

When using a hidden command (as described in the previous section), if the authorization passes, and the command is formatted correctly, the contents of the message will also be shared with Discord in order to fulfil your command.
